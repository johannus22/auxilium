# auxilium

Made by: John Rafael Masilungan (me) - main programmer 
and Riggs Ramos as the one who helped me.

Was our thesis project and one of my first ever project. Auxilium started as an idea of "Disaster Preparedness App" and upon communicating with our locale which is the MDRRMO Candelaria,
we've proposed this to our proffessors and approved. The term Auxilium is a latin word which means "Help" and this is to help the office by recording profiles, managing records and
SMS system.

The codes here might not be so proffessional but this made a bridge for me to pursue programming using PHP and to study its framework Laravel for future projects.
